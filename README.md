# Train_delay_analysis_in_June_2022

In everyday life, a large number of people use train as a means of public transport for their travels, whether for work or for reasons of study.

The commuting phenomenon is in fact a very developed phenomenon in Italy, especially in the north and near large cities.

A recent study of 31 December 2019 calculates that 30,214,401 people carry out daily stops to go to the place of study or work; this showed an increase over a previous 2011 study where people were 28,871,447; it is therefore an increase of 2.1% and this underlines the increase in importance assumed by railways of our state.

In this project, we have decided to focus on the our attention to the delays that trains accumulate, creating great inconvenience to passengers.
Using the API of the ViaggiaTreno website, we were able to collect data in June for about three weeks, more precisely from 9 to 30 June. In the data collected, you will find the departure and arrival times of the trains from railway stations; in this way it is possible to obtain the delay or advance of each train.
